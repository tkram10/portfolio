I am Kushal Ram Tayi, a Data Analyst and Java developer. Working for around two years in mphasis limited showed me how decision-making at such levels needs the assistance of data and analysis that can effectively drive initiatives. I grasped quickly that Business Analytics was slowly becoming the core of every organization across the board, prompting a demand for professionals who could fulfill such commitments.
To be a contributor to such an advanced idea of humankind has got me looking for options to build my skill set and set out on a mission to learn, explore, and experiment my way into an engaging career in business analytics at David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah.

## [Project-1: Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/tkram10/Career_Capstone)


This notebook aims to tackle credit default risk at Home Credit, a company extending loans to individuals lacking credit histories. Such individuals are often exploited by unreliable lenders, making it critical for Home Credit to ensure a positive borrowing experience.

Home Credit predicts clients' repayment abilities using various alternative data sources like telecom and transactional information. The core goal is to approve deserving clients and structure loans that facilitate financial success.

The process begins with data cleaning and preparing it for modeling. We then build predictive models to assess credit default risk, focusing on the target variable. Employing different machine learning models, we evaluate accuracy and ROC values to identify optimal models.
