# Kushal Ram Tayi

I am Kushal Ram Tayi, a Data Analyst and Java developer. Working for around two years in mphasis limited showed me how decision-making at such levels needs the assistance of data and analysis that can effectively drive initiatives. I grasped quickly that Business Analytics was slowly becoming the core of every organization across the board, prompting a demand for professionals who could fulfill such commitments.
To be a contributor to such an advanced idea of humankind has got me looking for options to build my skill set and set out on a mission to learn, explore, and experiment my way into an engaging career in business analytics at David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah.
